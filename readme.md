Notting Hill Carnival App - React js
====================================
A basic mapping app to show soundsystems and transport status at the Notting Hill Carnival.  
Part of this purpose of this project to learn more about React and Blender 3d.  

### How to run in development

```bash
$ npm start

# This is the same as running:
# $ webpack-dev-server --progress --colors --inline
```

Note the `--inline` flag. This means webpack __does not__ run in an iframe.  
This is important because React dev tools cannot inspect an iframe.  

Then preview at `http://localhost:8080/` (or whatever else it says in terminal).
